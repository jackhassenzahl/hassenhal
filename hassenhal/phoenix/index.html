			<h1>    Why Garrett should quit Clash Royale</h1>

			<p>As a Clash Royale player, you want to be challenged and provide a challenge to other people. In order to provide a challenge, you have to get good. Garrett never got good. Garrett only loses trophies. Instead of learning from his mistakes, he blames bad luck and overpowered cards, but the truth is he refuses to adapt, upgrade smartly, or practice real strategies. While others climb the ladder, Garrett sinks lower, becoming the kind of opponent nobody remembers—easy wins with no fight. He often times relies on his overlevelled baby dragon to deal with troops, but accuses his opponents of cheating when they play megaknight. (I wouldn't suggest anyone play Megaknight though. It is a card, but it is the most anoying card. Garrett might actually have a point here.) He absolutely falls apart whenever he plays any limited time game mode. Again, You have to get good. Garrett never got good, and Garrett only loses trophies.</p>

		<h3>3 reasons why Garrett is bad at the game</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Garrett only loses trophies</li>
				<li>Garrett can only bridge spam Hog Rider</li>
				<li>Garrett relies on overlevelled cards</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>How to play like Garrett (I don't know why you would want to do this, but here it is anyways)</h3>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Open Clash Royale</li>
				<li>Spend about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to edit your deck</li>
				<li>Make the most atrocious deck known to man kind</li>
				<li>Queue into a match and spam spells on the king tower</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>  A poem about Garrett on clash</h2>
		
			<p>Garrett hit the ladder, but he fell off quick,</p>
			<p>Droppin’ trophies every day, man his skills ain’t slick.</p>
			<p>Still spams Hog at the bridge like it’s 2016,</p>
			<p>Every push gets shut down, you know what I mean.</p>
			<p>No elixir count, no cycle in sight,</p>
			<p>Drops a Golem in the back, then he loses the fight.</p>
			<p>Always crying “overleveled!” but we know the deal,</p>
			<p>It ain’t the cards, bro—it’s your lack of skill.</p>
			<p>So remember the name when you see that tag,</p>
			<p>Garrett’s the free win, the Clash Royale lag.</p>
